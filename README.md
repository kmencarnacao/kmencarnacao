### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kelvin Encarnacao.

I am a current Masters of Science in Business Analytics student at the University of Iowa.
I have a comfortable programming background with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Iowa as well and am well versed
in languages: Python, Java, C++ but do most data science work currently in Python jupyter notebooks. I am interested in 
problem solving with data specifically in the healthcare pharmaceutical context and have experience working with machine learning 
predictive modeling in this context.
