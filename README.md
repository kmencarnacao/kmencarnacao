### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kelvin Encarnacao.

I obtained my Masters of Science in Business Analytics student at the University of Iowa.
I have a comfortable programming background with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Iowa as well and am well versed
in languages: Python, Java, C++ but do most data science work currently in Python jupyter notebooks. I am interested in 
problem solving with data in different applications and have experience working with machine learning 
predictive modeling among other machine learning modeling. For the last 2 years I have been working in machine learning science at Expedia
powering their recommendations team. I have interested in deep learning projects relating to NLP processes with LLMs as well as convolutional neural networks for computer vision tasks.
